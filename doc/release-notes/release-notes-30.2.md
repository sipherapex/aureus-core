How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Aureus-Qt` (on macOS)
or `aureusd`/`aureus-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Aureus Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Aureus Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Aureus Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the
Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Aureus
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Aureus Core on
unsupported systems.
